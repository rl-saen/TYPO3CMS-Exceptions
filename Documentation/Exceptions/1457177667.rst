   LTS 10.4.18 - 2021.08.06
   ====================================

   Situation
   ---------

   When trying to parse a TYPO3 link to a confirmation
   page the expection was thrown in TYPO3\CMS\Core\LinkHandling\Linkservice->resolveByStringRepresentation().

   Solution
   --------
   
   The string handed to the method was not a proper 
   t3:// link (i.e. t3://page?uid=1) but just the id as 
   string (so '1').
   
   Likely cause for me was an improper DB update when
   updating to LTS 10.
